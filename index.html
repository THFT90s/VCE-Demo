    <h1>Hi, I'm (Kwanza) </h1>
    <p>  I am basically having a midlife crisis and starting over. I have a degree in Medical Assisting (from FVTC too!) and worked in the field for just over 3 years and hated it. I randomly decided to quit and worked in retail for bit, and currently customer service. I love art and being expressive, the medical environment is too much for a achy breaky heart. Customer service, honestly the things people will do just to get a $5 off coupon is too dramatic for my theatrical soul. Like I get it but yeesh. Anyways, living as an artist is not practical for most, <i>sooooo</i> I had to brainstorm the best case scenrio to not live a really depressing life. I do not <b><i>-really-</i></b> have any programming background, but I remember dipping my toes with my MySpace page in middle school to have a better custom page.  </p>
    <p>I'm sure you did not get the reference,  (honestly it feels like I am the only person that remembers this guy anymore, haha) right click open new tab on "Paul Reference". It's one of the ending animations for Jimmy Neutron. I'm doing too much right now, I know, forgive me. </p>

<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>Really funky, fun, and animated sites and movie productions often have me pondering. Especailly the companies that achieve the above while being simple and not be visually overwhelming, as I can struggle with that sometimes. I love art, but I also ponder on the behind the scenes. I want to learn how to apply my creativity while also being able to manifest it's functionality on Beyonce's Internet. </p>
<p>Here's to a great semester! Ooot, Ooot! </p>
